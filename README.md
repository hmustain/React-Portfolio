## Description
This project is designed to take the skills I've learned in recent weeks, and apply them to updating my portfolio. This projects uses many of the fundamental skills we've learned over the course of 20 weeks and adds our new skill we learned this week, React. The goal of this project, is to set myself apart from other developers whose portfolios don't use the latest technologies.
